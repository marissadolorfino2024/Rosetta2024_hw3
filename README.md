# HW3

## Objectives for this assignment:
* Get started with VSCode and request access to summer institution VPN and HPC
* Write a Python program to satisfy a set of requirements in three separate problems
* Turn in homework assignment

This assignment attempts to build on the skills you learned in the previous assignment. There are three Python challenges for you to complete. Each requires you to implement code from scratch (looking up built-in functions and syntax is always encouraged).

## Tasks to complete

Please download VScode onto your personal computer. Make sure you know how to open a terminal on vscode, and that you have python and pip installed (instructions for installing python and pip can be found online).

* [ ] Upload a screenshot of the terminal in your VSCode
* [ ] Upload a screenshot of the results from running 'pip install numpy'
* [ ] Upload a screenshot of the results in your terminal when you type python and hit enter
* [ ] Contact your research mentor / PI and request access to the university VPN and to the high performance computing cluster (HPC) that you will be using for your research this summer. In the next homework, we will check that you have gained access to these resources, as they will be important for the codeschool.

* [ ] Upload a screenshot of the terminal in your VSCode
* [ ] Upload a screenshot of the results from running 'pip install numpy'
* [ ] Upload a screenshot of the results in your terminal when you type python and hit enter

## Problem 1, 2, and 3

You will complete these three coding challenges in the same notebook called homework3.ipynb. This notebook has a set of instructions for you to follow.

* [ ] Complete the homework3.ipynb notebook

## Turn in homework assignment

You will need to upload your completed notebook to your GitHub repository. To complete the assignment, you have made changes to the file `homework3.ipynb`.  Please delete the old version of the notebook and then upload the new version so that there are no duplicates.

Now you need to commit and push your changes to your repository. You can do this by following the instructions in the GitHub tutorial from HW1. 

* [ ] Commit and push your changes to your repository

## Final notes

Your first instinct should be to ask your peers for help using the Slack channel. No need to be shy! Let's keep Deniz's DMs free for important things like cat pictures and memes.

You are encouraged to reach out to your peers and the teaching team while working through this assignment. You can use the Slack channel to ask questions and discuss the homework. Thoroughly read through the assignment and attempt to complete it on your own before asking for help. When asking for help, be sure to include all relevant details and a screenshot of any error messages you are receiving (if applicable). 

## Answer key

The answer key for this assignment will be posted after the due date for the assignment has passed.
